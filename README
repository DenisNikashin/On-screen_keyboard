" A simple Virtual Keyboard for JavaFX 8 (version 8 is required to be able to use public
constructors for the KeyEvent class).

All important code is in VirtualKeyboard.java.
A simple use case is shown in VirtualKeyboardExample.java."

In this version, I'm trying to add multilanguage support.

The program is not finished
